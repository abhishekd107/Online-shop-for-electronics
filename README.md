# Online-shop-for-electronics (Capstone Project)

Title :- N.I.S.E. COMP.

The project is to build for the HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online shop for electronics. But I have  personalised the content, i.e., instead of a shop of electronics I have created an studying website "N.I.S.E. Comp". It is an website where contents can be bought through digital means, and knowledge can be shared digitally.
